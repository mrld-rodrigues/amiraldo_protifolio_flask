                    <p>
                        I am a multidisciplinary professional with experience in entomology and software development. 
                        I worked as an Endemic Disease Agent from 2003 to 2013 and Entomological Laboratory Technician 
                        from 2013 to 2016, monitoring mosquito populations and collaborating on public health campaigns. 
                        In 2016, I migrated to Portugal. In 2020, I transitioned into software development, where 
                        I developed a tool using Python, Kivy, and MariaDB, assists in the manipulation, storage, 
                        and generation of data for entomological research analysis, streamlining data collection 
                        and analysis processes for professionals in the field. I also completed a full-stack developer 
                        internship, building a system with WordPress, PHP, and MariaDB for IEFP. The system allows 
                        the registration of equipment faults, manages repairs, and sends automated email 
                        notifications, improving the efficiency of technical processes within the institution.
                        I am passionate about combining my expertise in science and technology to create impactful 
                        solutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I believe that technology is a powerful tool to transform businesses of any size and industry, 
                        and I’m here to help small businesses and entrepreneurs reach their full potential. 
                        With a creative and solution-driven approach, I help turn ideas into reality, 
                        from developing custom websites and apps to creating impactful digital experiences. 
                        My goal is always to deliver practical results, combining innovation and cutting-edge 
                        technology to drive success in an increasingly competitive market. 
                        Let’s embark on this journey toward digital excellence together!

                    <p>
                        In my work, I leverage a diverse set of technologies to bring projects 
                        to life. I use Python for its versatility and efficiency in backend 
                        development, along with Kivy and KivyMD to create intuitive, 
                        cross-platform mobile and desktop applications. For web development, 
                        I rely on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build dynamic and responsive user 
                        interfaces, using frameworks like Bootstrap to ensure that every design is 
                        mobile-friendly and visually appealing. My goal is to combine these 
                        technologies to create seamless digital solutions that meet the unique 
                        needs of each project.

                        <p>
                            APP_GEO_LOC is a lightweight Android application developed 
                            using Python, powered by Kivy and KivyMD, designed to 
                            retrieve and display the real-time geolocation of the 
                            user’s device on a map interface. Built with mobile 
                            simplicity and cross-platform flexibility in mind, 
                            the app fetches GPS coordinates and marks the current 
                            location visually with a pin on an interactive map, 
                            providing a straightforward way to track positioning 
                            on the go. Built with Python 3 and Kivy for the app’s 
                            structure and UI, using KivyMD to provide a polished 
                            Material Design look. It accesses Android’s GPS services 
                            to get real-time location data and displays a marker on 
                            a map via a map API. Packaged as an Android (.apk) app, 
                            it’s optimized for smooth touch interaction and performs 
                            well on low- to mid-range devices. This is a basic GPS 
                            location tracking, personal navigation, proof-of-concept 
                            for location-based apps, or as a foundation for more 
                            complex geolocation services.

                            Hangman is a modern reinterpretation of the classic hangman game, 
                            built from scratch in Python using the Pygame library. 
                            More than just guessing words, the game offers a dynamic experience 
                            with four progressive difficulty levels, ranging from simple and common 
                            words to complex and rare terms, with adaptive attempt limitations. 
                            Built entirely with Python 3 and Pygame for graphics rendering, 
                            event handling, and game state management. The structure is organized 
                            in modules to facilitate maintenance and expansion (game loop, 
                            level control, word system, UI). Simple and functional graphical interface, 
                            developed and tested exclusively on Linux – not yet compiled to .exe (Windows).

                            I completed a 210-hour internship at the IEFP in Portimão, where I developed a fault 
                            registration and management system for room devices. I worked as a full-stack developer, 
                            using WordPress, PHP, HTML, CSS, and MariaDB. The system manages repairs and sends email 
                            notifications. My activities included requirements gathering, frontend and backend 
                            development, database integration, and testing. This project enhanced my technical

                            It also serves as an indicator for actions against vector reproduction and disease 
                            transmission, generating key indices to measure egg positivity and density, as well as 
                            adult females. The tool produces IDO and IPO based on the division of areas covered

                            I worked as an Entomological Laboratory Technician, monitoring and controlling mosquito 
                            populations that transmit diseases like dengue, Zika, and chikungunya. 
                            My activities included installing ovitraps, identifying species, recording 
                            entomological data, and collaborating with epidemiological surveillance programs. 
                            I was also responsible for maintaining and calibrating laboratory equipment to 
                            ensure the quality of the analyses.

                            As an Endemics Disease Agent, I worked on controlling vector-borne diseases 
                            such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya. I visited homes and public places 
                            to eliminate mosquito breeding sites, treated areas with potential breeding 
                            grounds, and educated the public on prevention. I also applied larvicides and 
                            insecticides, collaborated on public health campaigns, and collected data for 
                            epidemiological surveillance in the municipality.

                        <p>
                            I studied from 5th to 12th grade at Colégio Encanto, where I developed academic 
                            and social skills. I participated in various extracurricular activities, 
                            such as science fairs and cultural events, which enhanced my teamwork abilities. 
                            The educational environment was stimulating, and the dedicated teachers 
                            contributed to my development. This period prepared me well for future challenges.
